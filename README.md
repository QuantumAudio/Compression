# Data Compression
This repository provides a deep understanding of DCT and MDCT compression algorithms. They're written in MATLAB, which is a C-style language. Each .zip file contains all the files needed to run the program and a .pdf file called "Description and Theory", which contains the code in the appendix for those who don't have MATLAB installed. It's part two in a three-part series on digital signal processing (DSP) design. The theory assumes the reader has taken a course in linear signals and systems as well as the introductory topics of DSP, including block-by-block processing methods. It can be read independently. If you're interested in an introduction to sample-by-sample processing methods, check out part one on [audio processors](https://github.com/QuantumAudio/Digital-Audio-Processors). Afterward, you can go to part three on [an introduction to machine learning](https://github.com/QuantumAudio/Introduction-to-Machine-Learning). Of course, if you just want the compression algorithms, feel free to use them.
