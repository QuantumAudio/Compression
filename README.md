# Data Compression
This repository contains DCT and MDCT compression algorithms written in MATLAB, as well as a main program that walks you through their development from theory and examples. It's part two in a three-part series from a digital signal processing (DSP) design course. The theory assumes the reader has taken a course in linear signals and systems as well as the introductory topics of DSP, including block-by-block processing methods. It can be read independently from the other two sections. If you're interested in an introduction to sample-by-sample processing methods, check out part one on [audio processors](https://github.com/QuantumAudio/Digital-Audio-Processors). After you're familiar with sample-by-sample processing, you can go to part three on [an introduction to machine learning](https://github.com/QuantumAudio/Introduction-to-Machine-Learning). Of course, if you just want the compression algorithms, feel free to use them.
